NOTE: This is in a separate file because JSON doesn't allow comments.

The x and y coordinates are swapped in this setup,
	i.e. x value indicates vertical value, y horizontal.
Also, the "origin" of the level grid (0, 0) is in the top left,
	rather than the bottom left.
This situation exists because of an OSI model layer 8 exception.
